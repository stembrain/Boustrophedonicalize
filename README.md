Boustrophedonicalize
====================

This script aims to take left-to-right text and arrange it boustrophedonically, that is alternating from left to right and right to left between lines. It may reverse word by word, or letter by letter. Maybe this will improve reading speeds because of reduced saccade time.

I'm thinking the Unicode character &amp;rlm; may be of consequence.
